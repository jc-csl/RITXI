# Reachy Mini Emotions Library

Curated emotion recordings for the Reachy Mini robot, maintained by
Pollen Robotics. Each move is a JSON trajectory (head pose, antennas,
body yaw, sampled over time) paired with an Opus audio track.

Motion is sampled at 50 Hz; audio is mono Ogg/Opus (decoded natively by
the robot). Requires `reachy_mini` ≥ v1.8.4 (its move loader resolves
non-`.wav` audio sidecars).

## File layout

Files live at the root of the dataset, named `<emotion>.json` +
`<emotion>.ogg`.

## How to use

**Python** — via the `reachy_mini` package:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.motion.recorded_move import RecordedMoves

library = RecordedMoves("pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-emotions-library")
with ReachyMini() as reachy:
    reachy.play_move(library.get("amazed1"))
```

**Marionette web app** — discoverable in the Community tab at
[huggingface.co/spaces/RemiFabre/marionette](https://huggingface.co/spaces/RemiFabre/marionette).

## Reuse

Keep the `reachy_mini_community_moves` tag when sharing derivatives so
the community can discover related sets.
